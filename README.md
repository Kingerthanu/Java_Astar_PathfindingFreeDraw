  A Java project created in 2022 where in a javafx GUI a user is able to use their cursor to draw walls. The walls cycle through the color spectrum and are used in creating a labrinthe in order for a given entry point to go to a given end point in the labrinthe. The user can use a single left-click in order to place the starting point and right click to add the end point. 
  When the user clicks ender, a A* algorithmn will traverse the given 2D matrix representation of this labrinthe in order to get to the exit. The quickest path will be traced in a purple line connecting the two points and the console will print out the step order to arrive there.
